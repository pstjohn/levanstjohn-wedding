Attire recommendations: <br/>
* Dress code is dressy, but not formal. Imagine what you would wear to a church picnic: something appropriately nice/dressy, but still somewhat casual. <br/>
* This is an afternoon wedding, during a time of year that can occasionally be warm. Please wear something you will be comfortable in for the climate.<br/>
* Women should wear flats or wedges (the ceremony and reception are on a grass field, so heels are inadvisable)<br/>
