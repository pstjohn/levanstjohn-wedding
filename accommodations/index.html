<h1>Where is <b>Martha&#39;s Vineyard</b> anyway?</h1>
<p>Martha&#39;s Vineyard is located in Massachusetts, approximately 4 miles due south of Cape Cod. 
Originally home to the Wampanoag, this area has been inhabited by people since glaciers receded from
from the island some 10,000 years ago. Today, the island is regarded as a prime spot for New England vacationers
so much so that sixty-three percent of the homes on the Vineyard belong to seasonal residents.
