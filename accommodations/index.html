<h2>Where is <b>Martha&#39;s Vineyard</b> anyway?</h2>
<p>Martha&#39;s Vineyard is located in Massachusetts, approximately 4 miles due south of Cape Cod. 
Originally home to the Wampanoag, this area has been inhabited by people since glaciers receded from
from the island some 10,000 years ago. Today, the island is regarded as a prime spot for New England vacationers--
so much so that sixty-three percent of the homes on the Vineyard belong to seasonal residents.

<h2>Where should I stay?</h2>
<p>Because this is a vacation hot spot, many houses are available for rent on a weekly basis (a few allow for 2 night minimums, but these will go quickly). 
Because house rentals are much nicer than an equivalent hotel room, we will put up a page for interested people to coordinate room shares through VRBO.
If you plan to use a hotel, there are options at multiple price points. <br/>
  <ul>
  <li><b>VRBO</b>: Rental options mostly require a week long stay, but some places allow a two night rental during the 
    wedding weekend. Book early to take advantage of shorter rental windows. Nightly rates can amount to $100 per person.</li><br/>
  <li><b>The Harborview</b>: Certainly one of the island&#39;s most luxurious options, this hotel has the greatest number of accomodations for visiting guests. 
  Room rates start at $519 per night.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Clarion Inn</b>: $381 per night, this hotel is outside of Edgartown center but proximal to public transit.</li><br/>
  <li><b>The Edgartown Inn</b>: Prices range from $175 - $295 per night. This establishment has just 14 rooms,
    is located right next to the Harborview, but has much more affordable pricing. The hotel starts taking 
    reservations on March 1.</li><br/>
  <li><b>The Marthas Vineyard Resort in Oak Bluffs</b>: Oak Bluffs is proximal to one of the primary ferry departure points, 
    but further from the reception site at Herring Creek Farm. It is nicely priced at $175/night, however, making it a good
    choice for budget travelers.</li><br/>
  </ul>
