<h2>Where is <b>Martha&#39;s Vineyard</b> anyway?</h2>
<p>Martha&#39;s Vineyard is located in Massachusetts, approximately 4 miles due south of Cape Cod. 
Originally home to the Wampanoag, this area has been inhabited by people since glaciers receded from
from the island some 10,000 years ago. Today, the island is regarded as a prime spot for New England vacationers
so much so that sixty-three percent of the homes on the Vineyard belong to seasonal residents.

<h2>Where should I stay?</h2>
<p>Because this is a vacation hot spot, many houses are available for rent on a weekly basis. 
If you plan to stay just the weekend, there are a few good options for hotels.<br/>
  <ul><b>The Harborview</b>: Certainly one of the islands most luxurious options, 
  this hotel has the greatest number of accomodations for visiting guests. Room rates start at $519 per night.<br/>
    <b>The Edgartown Inn:</b> Prices range from $175 - $295 per night. This establishment has just 14 rooms,
    is located right next to the Harborview, but has much more affordable pricing. The hotel starts taking 
    reservations on March 1.<br/>
    <b>VRBO</b>: Rental options mostly require a week long stay, but some places allow a two night rental during the 
    wedding weekend. Book early to take advantage of shorter rental windows. Nightly rates can amount to $100 per person.
